/**
 * Everything this platform runs on a clock, in one readable place.
 *
 * It lived in the `withSchedule` closure in `bootstrap/app.php`, which Laravel invokes from
 * `Artisan::starting` — so the schedule exists only inside a console process. A web request never
 * starts Artisan, which meant the admin Scheduler page could show the runs it had recorded and
 * could not show what is *supposed* to run: an operator could see that `payouts:mature` failed last
 * night and not that it should fire again at 02:00, and a task that had never run once was
 * indistinguishable from a task that does not exist.
 *
 * Naming it lets both callers read the same definition: the console registers it as before, and the
 * monitoring collector applies it to a throwaway Schedule to enumerate what is defined. There is
 * still exactly one list, so a task added here is monitored the moment it exists.
