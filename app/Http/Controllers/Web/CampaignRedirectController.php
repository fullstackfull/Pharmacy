/**
 * The short link a campaign hands out.
 *
 * The security shape matters more than the feature. This endpoint never redirects to a URL from
 * the request: it looks up a row an administrator created, re-validates that row's destination
 * against the allow-list, and only then sends the visitor. A code that does not exist, is
 * inactive, has expired, or whose destination no longer passes is not followed — the visitor goes
 * to the shop's home page instead of anywhere an attacker chose.
 *
 * Everything analytics-related here is best-effort. A printed QR on a shop window has to work when
 * the analytics database does not.
