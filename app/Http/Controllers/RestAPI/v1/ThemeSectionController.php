/**
 * The published theme, for a client that is not the web storefront.
 *
 * The theme builder, Banner Setup and the storefront are already one system on the web:
 * StorefrontThemeRenderer serves the PUBLISHED version, and blockCards() resolves every
 * banner-backed block against its Promotion → Banners row live — an edit in Banner Setup shows on
 * the storefront without touching the theme, and unpublishing a banner hides its tile. The mobile
 * app had no way into that pipeline, so integrators queried theme_sections by hand: a hardcoded
 * version id that goes stale on the next publish, no publish-state checks, no banner overrides,
 * and a query per block.
 *
 * This endpoint IS that pipeline. Whatever the merchant publishes in the builder is what it
 * answers, section order and visibility included; whatever they edit in Banner Setup is live in
 * it, exactly as on the web. It adds only what a phone needs and a blade does not: image URLs are
 * made absolute, because the app has no origin to resolve `/storage/...` against.
