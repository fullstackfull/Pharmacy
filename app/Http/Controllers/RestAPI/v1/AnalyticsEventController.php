/**
 * The app's door to the same beacon the storefront writes through.
 *
 * The web reports what a page load cannot see; the app has to report rather more, because in the
 * app almost nothing IS a page load. A shopper who taps a banner and lands on a product screen
 * makes one API call for that product and none that says a banner sent them there — so a merchant
 * comparing two banners had numbers for the web half of their audience and nothing at all for the
 * half on a phone.
 *
 * Public and unauthenticated, like the storefront's beacon and for the same reason: a banner is
 * shown to guests, and an endpoint that only accepted signed-in shoppers would report a biased
 * subset while looking complete. The trade is bounded the same way — the payload rules are the
 * beacon's own [ClientEventIngest], so only allow-listed names are accepted, none of them carry
 * money, ids are coerced to digits and every other key is dropped.
 *
 * It answers 204 to everything, including a payload it rejects entirely: an app cannot act on the
 * difference, and an error status would teach a prober what the endpoint accepts.
