/**
 * Puts the web session's seller principal where everything else already looks for it.
 *
 * The seller app authenticates with a token and the panel with a session, but "who is acting, and
 * on whose shop" is the same question and must have the same answer. Resolving both into the same
 * `SellerPrincipal`, on the same request attribute, means one permission gate
 * (`EnsureSellerPermission`), one audit actor (`AuditLogger`) and one navigation filter serve both
 * clients — rather than a second authorization system that drifts from the first.
 *
 * It never decides access on its own: an unresolvable principal is sent back to sign in, and every
 * permission question is answered by the route's own gate.
