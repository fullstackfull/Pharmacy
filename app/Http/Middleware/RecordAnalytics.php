/**
 * Opens the visit and closes the books.
 *
 * Terminable on purpose: the visitor cookie has to be queued during the request so it reaches the
 * browser, but every write happens in terminate(), after the response has been sent. A shopper
 * never waits for analytics, and an analytics failure cannot reach their page.
 *
 * Only real navigations count as pageviews. An ajax poll, a JSON endpoint, an image and a redirect
 * are not pages a person looked at, and counting them is how a bounce rate ends up being computed
 * against a denominator that includes the cart's stock-check request.
