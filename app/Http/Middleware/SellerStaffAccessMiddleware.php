/**
 * Enforces a seller staff member's permissions across the vendor panel (Phase 3, Stage A).
 *
 * Runs after the `seller` guard on the vendor route group. A **real seller** (no `seller_staff_id` in
 * session) passes straight through — this middleware never changes owner behavior. A **staff** session
 * is one where the owner signed in through the staff login, which logs the staff in as their parent
 * seller (so all existing `auth('seller')` scoping keeps working) and stamps `seller_staff_id`.
 *
 * For a staff request the required permission is derived from the vendor URL, and `staffCan()` decides.
 * The map is **deny-by-default**: a navigation/self area is allowed to any active staff, a core domain
 * requires its catalog permission, and anything unmapped is refused (403) — so a gap fails closed, never
 * open. Read (GET) needs the `.view` permission where a domain has one; writes need `.manage`.
