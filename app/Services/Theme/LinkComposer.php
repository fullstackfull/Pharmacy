/**
 * A destination, chosen rather than typed.
 *
 * The builder stores every link as a storefront URL, and until now a merchant produced that URL by
 * hand: copy the address bar, paste it into a text box, hope. It is the single most fragile input
 * in the whole builder, and it is the one that decides where a banner goes. A trailing slash, a
 * query parameter in the wrong order, a link copied from an admin page rather than a shop page —
 * each produces a link that works on the web and opens the wrong screen, or a browser, on a phone.
 *
 * This is the other direction from {@see ActionResolver}. That one reads a URL and says what it
 * means; this takes what the merchant meant — this category, that brand, the best sellers — and
 * writes the URL that means it. The stored value stays a URL, so every renderer, the storefront and
 * the app's typed actions keep working with no migration and no new column.
 *
 * The contract between the two is a round trip: whatever this composes, the resolver must read back
 * as the same destination. A test holds that for every kind, because the pair silently disagreeing
 * would put the builder back where it started, with a nicer control.
