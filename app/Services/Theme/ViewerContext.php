 * Who is being served, in the only terms the theme engine is allowed to ask about.
 *
 * Deliberately small. A visibility rule that can read anything about a shopper becomes a profiling
 * surface by accident, and every field here has to be defensible on its own: the platform and
 * device decide which renderer will draw the section, the auth flag decides whether a
 * customer-only rail makes sense, the locale decides which translation to hand back, and the
 * capabilities decide what the client can draw at all. Nothing identifies a person.
 *
 * Immutable, and constructible from an HTTP request or by hand — the second is what lets the
 * builder preview a legacy phone from an admin browser.
