/**
 * Whether a section runs right now, for this viewer — the one rule, read by every renderer.
 *
 * There are four independent switches and they were previously spread across three files, which is
 * how a section ends up visible on the web and invisible in the app for reasons nobody can trace:
 *
 *   is_visible     the structure panel's switch (already applied by the query)
 *   settings.visible  the settings panel's switch, plus its per-breakpoint siblings
 *   schedule       starts_at / ends_at, evaluated against the SHOP's clock
 *   targeting      platforms and audience
 *
 * Time is the reason this is server-side. A campaign that ends at midnight has to end at the
 * shop's midnight; a phone with a wrong clock — or a deliberately wrong one — would otherwise
 * decide for itself when a promotion runs.
 *
 * Every method also explains itself: `reasonFor()` returns the switch that stopped a section, which
 * is what the builder shows a merchant who is looking at a section that will not appear.
