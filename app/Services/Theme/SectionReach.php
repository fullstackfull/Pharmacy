 * How many shoppers actually reached each section.

 * The builder answers "what did I arrange". Nothing answered "did anyone get that far" — and that
 * is the question an arrangement exists to settle. A rail nobody scrolls to looks identical, in
 * every screen there was, to one at the top that everybody sees, and only one of those is fixed by
 * moving it up.
 *
 * Read from the analytics rollup rather than the raw events: the rollup has already excluded bots
 * and staff, which is the difference between "shoppers saw this" and "something requested the
 * page". A shop with analytics not installed, or not yet rolled up, gets an empty map and the
 * builder simply says nothing — an absent number is honest, an invented one is not.
