/**
 * Where a section's DATA comes from, named per instance.
 *
 * A section payload carries a section's LOOK — settings, blocks, cards. Its products, categories
 * and vendors live behind the catalogue APIs, and which endpoint applies depends on what the
 * merchant chose in the builder. Spelling that mapping out is what makes the home page drivable
 * from the builder at all: the client renders the section list in order and follows each section's
 * `source`, instead of hardcoding which rail calls which endpoint.
 *
 * `kind` is one of:
 *   inline — everything needed is already in the payload (banners, text, FAQs, stats)
 *   api    — fetch `endpoint` with `params`; every endpoint named here exists in v1
 *   none   — no public API feeds this section yet; `note` says what is missing, so an absent rail
 *            reads as a known gap rather than a bug
 *
 * Extracted from the mobile sections endpoint so the versioned delivery path and the original
 * endpoint cannot drift into two different answers for the same section.
