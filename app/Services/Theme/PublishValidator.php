/**
 * What is wrong with a version, asked before it becomes what every customer sees.
 *
 * Publishing is the one irreversible-feeling action in the builder: a draft is private and a
 * published version is the shop. Everything needed to catch a broken publish already existed — the
 * readiness rule knows a section will not render, the compatibility report knows the app will not
 * receive it — but nothing asked them at the moment it mattered, so a merchant found out by
 * looking at the live site, or did not find out at all.
 *
 * Two severities, and the line between them is who can fix it:
 *
 *   blocking — the merchant left something unset. The section will silently not appear, and one
 *              click in the panel they are already in resolves it. Publishing waits.
 *   warning  — the configuration is right and the world is not: no coupon is live, the app has no
 *              renderer for this type, the schedule has passed. Publishing proceeds; the merchant
 *              is told what they are shipping.
 *
 * Nothing here re-derives an answer that already has an owner. {@see SectionReadiness} decides
 * whether a section renders and {@see ThemeCompatibilityReport} decides what the app receives;
 * this decides what to do about it.
