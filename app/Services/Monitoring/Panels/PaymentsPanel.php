/**
 * Payments: what the shop recorded taking, and everywhere the record contradicts itself.
 *
 * Two halves that must never be read as one. The top half is VOLUME — the payment events analytics
 * writes, folded by gateway. The bottom half is INTEGRITY — nine reconciliations between the
 * gateway ledger, the orders table and the settlement ledger, each of which is a defect when it
 * returns a row. They are separated because they answer different questions and, more importantly,
 * because only one of them has a trustworthy denominator.
 *
 * The denominator is the reason this page is shaped the way it is. Until the change that ships with
 * it, `digital_payment_fail()` in app/Utils/module-helper.php had an EMPTY BODY: a declined card, a
 * timed-out gateway and a shopper who closed the tab all left one row in payment_requests with
 * is_paid = 0 and nothing else, indistinguishable from each other and from an attempt that never
 * happened. Failures are recorded from now on. They were not recorded before. So a success rate has
 * no denominator for any window that reaches back past the first recorded failure, and this panel
 * refuses to print one there rather than dividing by a number that does not exist — a 100% success
 * rate computed over zero recorded failures is the single most dangerous figure this section could
 * carry. `payment_started` is still emitted by nothing at all, so abandonment before the gateway
 * answered remains invisible and is declared rather than assumed to be zero.
 *
 * Cost is the other constraint that shows on the surface. payment_requests carries NO INDEX AND NO
 * PRIMARY KEY, and order_transactions, paytabs_invoices, refund_transactions and offline_payments
 * are indexed on their own id and nothing else — every read of them is a full table scan. So this
 * page reconciles ONE bounded sample: the orders created inside the selected window, newest first,
 * up to a fixed cap, read on idx_orders_created_at. Everything else is looked up by that sample's
 * ids and references, one scan per table per page load, and only when the table is small enough to
 * scan safely. A table over the ceiling is not read at all: the block says so and names the index
 * that would make it readable, because an admin page must not be able to take the shop down.
