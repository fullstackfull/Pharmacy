/**
 * The database, answered from three directions — because "the database is slow" is three different
 * complaints and they have three different fixes.
 *
 * The server's own counters say whether MySQL itself is in trouble: out of connections, missing the
 * buffer pool, waiting on row locks. The slow-query ledger says which individual statement is
 * expensive enough to be worth an index. And the request buckets say which ROUTE is spending the
 * database's time — which is the only one of the three that finds an N+1, because an N+1 is a
 * hundred and forty-five perfectly fast queries and every per-statement view calls it healthy.
 *
 * This shop has exactly that: the storefront home issues roughly 145 statements per request, none
 * of them slow. It is invisible in the slow-query table by construction, and it is the first row of
 * the query-heavy-routes table. Both are on this page so the absence in one explains the other.
 *
 * Nothing here is inferred from anything else. Where the login may not read a counter — this
 * deployment has performance_schema OFF and no PROCESS privilege — the metric arrives from the
 * collector already carrying its state and the exact grant or setting that would make it real, and
 * it is rendered that way rather than as a zero.
