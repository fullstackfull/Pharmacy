/**
 * Logs: the lines the application wrote, read from the file it wrote them to.
 *
 * This build has no log table. The 'single' channel appends to storage/logs/laravel.log, so the
 * only honest source is the file, and reading a file is the part of this system most able to take
 * the site down with it: an unrotated laravel.log on a busy store is routinely hundreds of
 * megabytes, and file_get_contents() on one is an out-of-memory error on the monitoring page.
 *
 * So the read is bounded three ways and each bound is reported rather than hidden. Only the tail
 * is read, backwards in chunks from the end, stopping at 2 MB or once enough entry headers have
 * gone past; at most 200 entries come back. When the tail did not reach the start of the file the
 * payload says so, because "these are the last 200 lines" and "this is the whole log" are
 * different claims and only one of them is usually true.
 *
 * Two things here are about honesty rather than convenience.
 *
 * The log file's timestamps are NOT UTC. Monolog writes them in the process timezone, which
 * Laravel sets from app.timezone — Asia/Dhaka on this deployment — while everything monitoring
 * stores is UTC. Parsing a log line as if it were UTC would shift every entry by six hours and
 * line it up against the wrong deploy, which is the same class of bug Clock exists to prevent. So
 * each line is parsed in the log's own timezone and converted once, through Clock::display().
 *
 * And LOG_LEVEL decides what is in the file at all. At `warning` there is no info or debug line to
 * find, so a quiet log is not evidence that nothing happened — it is evidence about the threshold.
 * The panel reports the threshold next to the entries for exactly that reason.
