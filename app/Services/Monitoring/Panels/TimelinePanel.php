/**
 * One axis: everything that happened to this system, in the order it happened.
 *
 * The value of a timeline is not the list. It is the sentence "p95 doubled at 14:20 and the deploy
 * was at 14:19" — and that sentence is only available when every kind of event lands on the same
 * axis. So this panel reads monitoring_events across all eight types rather than one, and lays the
 * two tables that carry their own history — monitoring_deployments and monitoring_incidents —
 * beside it, so a release or an outage that never reached the axis is visible as a gap rather than
 * as an absence of trouble.
 *
 * The trap this page is shaped around: an empty axis reads as a quiet week. It is not. Six of the
 * eight types now have producers — deploy, backup, incident, alert, check and scheduler — and two,
 * config and annotation, have none anywhere in this build. A page that drew all eight as one silent
 * line would report calm where the truth is that nobody is writing. So the legend states, per type,
 * whether this build can produce it at all, when it last did, and how many are inside the window;
 * and every count on this page is measured rather than assumed, so a zero here is a real zero.
 *
 * Nothing on this page is a measurement taken now. The axis is a record, written at the moment each
 * thing happened by the producer that knew about it.
