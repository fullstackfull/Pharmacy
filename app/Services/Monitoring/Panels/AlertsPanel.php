/**
 * The alert engine: what it watches, what it is saying, and whether it is still awake.
 *
 * Two questions decide whether this page is worth anything, and they are asked in this order.
 *
 * First: is the engine running? Every other statement here — "nothing is firing", "everything is
 * ok" — is a claim about the last time `monitoring:evaluate` actually ran. If that was an hour
 * ago, a table of green pills is not calm, it is a stopped clock, so the freshness of the state
 * rows is established before a single rule is shown.
 *
 * Second: could each rule fire at all? A rule watching a metric that has not arrived for two days
 * is silent for the same reason a healthy shop is silent, and the two are indistinguishable from
 * the state column alone. Each row therefore carries whether its metric has been seen recently.
 *
 * A rule with no state row has NEVER been evaluated. That is not "ok", and it is not zero — it is
 * its own state, and it is drawn as one.
