/**
 * Web performance: what real shoppers experienced, measured in their own browsers.
 *
 * Every other speed figure in this console is measured on the server. This one is not, and that is
 * the whole reason the section exists: PHP can answer in 40ms while the page is unusable, because
 * the font blocked the first paint, the banner reflowed the layout after two seconds, or the first
 * three taps were ignored. Only the browser sees those, so only the browser can report them.
 *
 * WHICH FIGURE THIS PAGE SHOWS, AND WHICH IT DOES NOT. The published way to read a Core Web Vital
 * is the 75th percentile of visits. This store keeps per-minute aggregates, not a sample per visit,
 * so a p75 cannot be computed from it — and a p75 derived from a mean is not a p75, it is a mean
 * with a more authoritative name. What the recorder CAN compute exactly is how many visits fell in
 * each of the three published bands, so the band split is the headline figure here and the mean is
 * drawn beside it with its sample count, labelled as a mean. Both are true; neither is called a
 * p75. WebVitalsRecorder's own docblock is the source of that decision.
 *
 * AN EMPTY PAGE IS A STATEMENT ABOUT VISITS, NOT ABOUT SPEED. Nothing here is sampled by a
 * collector on a timer: a reading exists only because a real browser loaded a real page and posted
 * it back as the page went away. So "no data" means nobody visited (or the beacon is switched off),
 * never "the shop was fast", and the collection block above the numbers says which of the two it
 * is before a single figure is drawn.
 *
 * CLS is stored multiplied by a thousand so it can share one integer-friendly pipeline with the
 * timings. It is divided back here and labelled a score rather than a duration.
