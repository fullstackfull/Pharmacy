/**
 * The error centre: exceptions grouped into the bug behind them.
 *
 * "Fourteen errors in the last hour" is a number nobody can act on. One group with fourteen
 * occurrences, a first seen, a last seen and a stack trace is a bug report — so everything here is
 * built around the group, and individual occurrences exist only to give a group the concrete
 * example that makes it debuggable.
 *
 * The distinction the page leads with is new against recurring. An exception that has been failing
 * quietly for a month and one that started eleven minutes after a deploy demand completely
 * different reactions, and the only thing that tells them apart is first_seen_at against the
 * window.
 *
 * Two counts are deliberately kept apart rather than added together. A group's `occurrences` is a
 * lifetime counter that outlives the occurrence rows retention prunes; the in-window count is read
 * from monitoring_errors. Showing the lifetime counter under a heading that says "this window"
 * would be the easiest lie on this page, so both are carried and both are labelled.
 *
 * Every part reports its own state. A panel that catches its own failure can say which half could
 * not be read instead of blanking a section that was mostly fine.
