/**
 * Traces: where one request's time actually went.
 *
 * Every other performance section answers "which route is slow". Only a trace answers the question
 * that follows it — of the 724ms, which 410 were a query, which 80 were an outbound call, and what
 * was the application itself doing for the rest. That is the whole purpose of this section, so the
 * span waterfall is the page and the list above it is only the way to reach one.
 *
 * Two decisions here are about honesty rather than presentation.
 *
 * The by-kind split is read from the request's own counters on monitoring_traces, not from summing
 * the spans. Spans nest — a controller span contains the query spans inside it — so adding their
 * durations together double counts, and a stacked bar built that way would routinely claim more
 * milliseconds than the request took. The counters are accumulated per category and cannot.
 *
 * The remainder is never called "application time" without saying what else is in it. It is the
 * total minus what was measured, so it holds PHP execution AND everything this build does not
 * instrument. Labelling it as pure application code would be a measurement nobody took.
