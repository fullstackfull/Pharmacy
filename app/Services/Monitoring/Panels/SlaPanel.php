/**
 * Availability, the error budget it spends, and how long the incidents took.
 *
 * Nothing in this system stores an uptime percentage, so every number on this page is derived here
 * from measurements taken elsewhere: the check.up series CheckRunner writes on every probe, the
 * timestamps IncidentManager stamps on an incident, and the request and dependency buckets the
 * ingest already folds. That is deliberate — a stored uptime figure is a claim, and a figure
 * recomputed from the probes each time it is asked for can be argued with.
 *
 * ONE RULE MAKES THE NUMBER DEFENSIBLE, and it is CheckRunner's, mirrored here rather than
 * reinvented: a check that was not_configured, not_supported or unknown is NEITHER UP NOR DOWN and
 * is excluded from the denominator entirely. It is never folded in as 100%. CheckRunner enforces
 * this at the point of writing — those statuses produce no check.up sample at all — so the
 * exclusion is already in the data; what this panel adds is saying out loud which checks it
 * removed and why, because an availability figure whose denominator is invisible is a slogan.
 *
 * The second thing this page must not be allowed to imply: availability here means THE CHECKS THAT
 * RAN SAID THE COMPONENT ANSWERED. It does not mean customers could shop. A probe of the database
 * connection is not a checkout, and unless a synthetic journey is configured nothing on this
 * deployment ever exercises one. So the basis block states the denominator, the probe cadence and
 * whether any journey contributed, and the view leads with it rather than with the percentage.
 *
 * Availability is counted in PROBES, not minutes, and the error budget with it. Minutes between two
 * probes are not observed, so spending a budget in minutes would be spending time nobody measured;
 * the minute figures on this page are labelled as what they are — the probe count multiplied by the
 * five-minute cadence — and the probe counts are what the arithmetic is done in.
 *
 * MTTD is real but degenerate, and says so beside itself: detected_at is stamped when the alert
 * rule fired and started_at is when the metric first breached, so their difference is the rule's
 * hold time rather than how long anybody took to notice. MTTR is genuine. Both carry the number of
 * incidents they were averaged over, because a mean with no n beside it is not a statistic.
