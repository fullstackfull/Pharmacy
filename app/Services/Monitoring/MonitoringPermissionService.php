/**
 * Who may see what inside Monitoring.
 *
 * Monitoring shows more about a business than almost any other screen: revenue as it happens,
 * customer traffic, error messages that quote real data, server credentials' effects, and a log
 * viewer. "Every admin sees everything" is the wrong default for that, so the area is split into
 * capabilities that can be granted separately.
 *
 * It layers on the panel's existing RBAC exactly the way ThemePermissionService does, rather than
 * inventing a parallel system: the coarse `system_settings` module grant is still enforced by the
 * route middleware, and these finer capabilities are read from the same `module_access` JSON on
 * the admin's role. A role that predates this feature and simply holds the module keeps the
 * ordinary read-only view — but logs, security and settings have to be granted deliberately,
 * because those are the three that expose data and change behaviour.
 *
 * Keys follow the project's existing convention (`theme_view`, `theme_publish`), and the dotted
 * spellings are accepted as aliases so either form works in a stored role.
