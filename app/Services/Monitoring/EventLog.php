/**
 * The one axis: everything that HAPPENED to this system, in the order it happened.
 *
 * monitoring_events was designed for eight kinds of event — deploy, scheduler, backup, incident,
 * alert, config, check, annotation — and exactly one of them was ever written: a scheduled task
 * that failed. So the timeline could only ever draw a line of scheduler failures, and the alerts
 * page had a permanent, tested discrepancy against it (AlertHistoryDiscrepancyTest): the rule state
 * counted firings that the timeline had never been told about.
 *
 * The fix is not a bigger reader. It is this: one place that writes an event, called from each of
 * the seams where something actually happens. Writing it in eight places would have meant eight
 * spellings of `type`, and a timeline whose filters silently miss half the rows.
 *
 * Nothing here may throw. An event that cannot be recorded is a gap in a chart; an exception on
 * this path would be an outage caused by the thing that exists to notice outages.
