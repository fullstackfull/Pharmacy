/**
 * The server in front of PHP: which one is actually serving, and what it is doing right now.
 *
 * Three things this deliberately does NOT do, because each is a standard way a web server panel
 * misleads the person reading it:
 *
 * 1. It does not answer "which web server" from the SAPI alone. The once-a-minute gauge sample
 *    runs under the CLI, where SERVER_SOFTWARE does not exist and php_sapi_name() describes this
 *    process and nothing else — so detection falls through to the process table, and a box running
 *    `php artisan serve` is named as the development server it is. Reporting a development server
 *    as an nginx that fails every probe would put a page of red on a machine that is working
 *    exactly as intended.
 *
 * 2. It does not divide since-start counters by uptime. stub_status `requests` and mod_status
 *    `Total Accesses` both climb from the moment the server started, and Apache even hands over a
 *    ready-made `ReqPerSec` computed that way — the server's lifetime average dressed as current
 *    load, a number that stays calm through the busiest hour it has ever had. Every rate here is a
 *    delta against a cached previous reading, and the first sample says so rather than guessing.
 *
 * 3. It does not go blank when no status endpoint is configured, which is most deployments. The
 *    status-class mix and the request rate come from the shop's own per-minute buckets, measured
 *    on the way out of PHP. Those two sources are never mixed under one name: nginx counts every
 *    static asset it answered by itself, PHP counts only what reached PHP, and folding one into
 *    the other would put a step change in a chart the day someone exposes stub_status.
