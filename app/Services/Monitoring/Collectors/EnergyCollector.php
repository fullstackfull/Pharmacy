/**
 * Power draw, and what it costs — only where the hardware can actually be asked.
 *
 * Energy is the metric dashboards invent most freely, because nothing on the screen distinguishes
 * a wattage read off a hardware counter from one produced by multiplying a CPU percentage by two
 * numbers somebody typed into a settings page. The cost figure derived from the second looks
 * exactly like a bill. So three rules hold here:
 *
 * 1. Measured means RAPL/powercap or a BMC and nothing else. No counters, no watts: the panel says
 *    which telemetry is missing instead of showing a plausible number.
 *
 * 2. An estimate exists, but only when an operator switches it on deliberately, and every value it
 *    produces says "Estimated" in its own note — including the money — so it can never be quoted
 *    back as a measurement.
 *
 * 3. RAPL exposes monotonic microjoule counters that wrap at a domain-specific ceiling, so watts
 *    is the difference between two readings over the time between them — never a counter divided
 *    by uptime — and the first sample after a restart reports no data instead of a number.
 *
 * What RAPL covers is also narrower than people assume: the CPU package, plus DRAM where the
 * platform meters it separately. Disks, NICs, fans and PSU losses are not in it. That makes the
 * reading a floor for the machine's wall draw rather than the wall draw, which is stated on the
 * metric instead of being quietly rounded away.
