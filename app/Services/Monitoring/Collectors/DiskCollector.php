/**
 * Disk: what is left on each filesystem, and what the devices under them are doing.
 *
 * Four things this deliberately does NOT do, because each of them is a way disk monitoring lies:
 *
 * 1. It does not turn /proc/diskstats into rates by dividing by uptime. Those are monotonic
 *    counters since boot; IOPS, throughput, latency and utilisation only exist as a difference
 *    between two readings. The previous reading is cached and the delta is what gets reported —
 *    on the first sample the answer is "no data yet", never a lifetime average dressed up as now.
 *
 * 2. It does not count a partition and its parent device as two disks. vda1's I/O is vda's I/O,
 *    and adding them would double every number on the page.
 *
 * 3. It does not skip inodes because PHP has no API for them. A filesystem can refuse to create a
 *    file with 200 GB free and df -h looking perfectly healthy — that outage costs hours precisely
 *    because nothing on the dashboard hinted at it. So `df -i` is shelled out to where the host
 *    allows it, and where it does not, the metric says so and carries the fix.
 *
 * 4. It does not report the root reserve as used space. statvfs — and therefore every PHP disk
 *    function — exposes only the blocks an unprivileged process may write, so `total - free`
 *    silently counts the kernel's reservation as consumption. On a filesystem with a large
 *    reserve that reads as a disk about to fill up while `df` says it is half empty, and the
 *    thresholds in config/monitoring.php would raise a critical alert on a healthy machine. df
 *    is asked for the real split where the host allows it, and the fallback says out loud that
 *    it is approximating.
