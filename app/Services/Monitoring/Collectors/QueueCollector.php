/**
 * The queue, per queue name, and whether anything is actually draining it.
 *
 * Five things this deliberately does NOT do, because each one is a standard way a queue panel
 * reassures the person reading it while the queue is dead:
 *
 * 1. It does not treat depth as health. Three jobs stuck for an hour is an outage; three thousand
 *    flowing through is a busy evening. The age of the oldest waiting job is therefore the headline
 *    number here, and depth is reported beside it rather than instead of it.
 *
 * 2. It does not report "0 workers" when it simply cannot see. Counting processes needs a shell,
 *    and shared hosting routinely takes that away — so with exec disabled the worker count comes
 *    back permission_denied, not zero. "No worker is running" and "I cannot tell" lead an operator
 *    to opposite actions, and only one of them is recoverable from a wrong guess.
 *
 * 3. It does not describe the sync driver as an empty queue. On sync a dispatched job runs inside
 *    the request that dispatched it: there is nothing to be behind, so pending and lag do not exist
 *    rather than being zero — and a green "0 pending" would hide the fact that every job is running
 *    on the customer's page load.
 *
 * 4. It does not read reserved_at as proof of progress. A worker killed mid-job leaves its
 *    reservation behind until retry_after expires, so a row that says "being processed" can mean
 *    "was being processed by a process that no longer exists". Reservations older than retry_after
 *    are counted separately and reported as the worker failure they are.
 *
 * 5. It does not call a paused queue a stalled one. `queue:pause` is a deliberate act; jobs piling
 *    up behind it is the intended behaviour, and reporting that as a dead worker sends someone
 *    restarting supervisors that are working perfectly.
