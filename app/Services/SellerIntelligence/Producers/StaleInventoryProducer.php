/**
 * Stock that is not going anywhere, and listings that contradict their own stock.
 *
 * Three findings that share one query over the catalogue, because running three sweeps over the same
 * table to ask three questions about each row is how a nightly job becomes a nightly outage.
 *
 * **Not moving.** Units sitting on a shelf are money the seller has already spent. This is the one
 * finding here that is an opportunity as much as a problem, and it is reported as an issue only
 * because the money is already committed — an opportunity is something you could do, this is
 * something you already did.
 *
 * **Live with nothing to sell.** A published product at zero stock takes a customer to a dead end
 * and spends the seller's search placement doing it.
 *
 * **Hidden with stock to sell.** The mirror image, and the more expensive of the two: paid-for units
 * nobody can buy because the listing is switched off.
