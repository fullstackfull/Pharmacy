/**
 * Prices that are probably a mistake.
 *
 * Both findings became possible only once price changes started being recorded — before that, a
 * price that halved overnight left nothing behind to notice.
 *
 * **An extreme move.** A price that changed by more than half in one write is either a deliberate
 * clearance or a typo, and the platform cannot tell which. It says so in those terms rather than
 * asserting a mistake: this is a prompt to confirm, not an accusation. Deliberate moves are
 * confirmed once and stop being raised, because the detector only looks at recent changes.
 *
 * **Selling below cost.** Only where the seller recorded a purchase price. Where they did not, this
 * says nothing at all rather than guessing at a margin — a made-up cost would produce a made-up
 * loss, which is worse than silence.
