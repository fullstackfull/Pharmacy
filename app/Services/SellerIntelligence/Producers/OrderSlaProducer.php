/**
 * Orders the seller still owes an action on, and how long they have left.
 *
 * The marketplace already measures SLA breaches after the fact — SlaService writes them to the
 * breach ledger and the scorecard reads them. That is accountability, not help: by the time a breach
 * exists the order is already late. This producer looks at orders still inside their window and
 * tells the seller which ones are about to fall out of it.
 *
 * The deadline is derived from the order's own age against the configured window, so it is the same
 * clock the marketplace judges them by — not a second, kinder one.
