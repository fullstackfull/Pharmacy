/**
 * Listings under a brand this seller is not entitled to sell.
 *
 * This is the half of the brand registry that does something before enforcement is switched on. A
 * gate that silently starts refusing listings is a bad way for a legitimate reseller to find out
 * they needed paperwork; a finding that says which of their listings will be affected, while they
 * can still do something about it, is a good one.
 *
 * It reports only what is real. A brand nobody has claimed produces nothing — the registry treats it
 * as open, and inventing a compliance problem for it would be exactly the fabricated finding the
 * brief rules out. What it reports is the concrete case: somebody else has proved ownership of this
 * name to a person, and these listings of yours carry it.
 *
 * The severity floor is deliberate. Selling under somebody else's brand is not a matter of degree
 * measured against the seller's turnover — a shop where it happens twice has the same problem as a
 * shop where it happens two hundred times, and the engine ranking it low because the shop is large
 * would be the wrong answer.
