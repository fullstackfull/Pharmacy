/**
 * Problems get worse by being ignored.
 *
 * The severity engine measures how bad a finding is when it is detected. This measures what happens
 * afterwards: an issue that was medium yesterday, is past its deadline today and nobody has touched
 * is not still medium. Without this, a seller who ignores everything sees the same list forever and
 * the platform never says anything louder.
 *
 * Three properties make it escalation rather than noise:
 *
 * **It only ever climbs, and only one step at a time.** `escalation_level` records how far a row has
 * been promoted, so a sweep that runs hourly does not promote the same issue hourly. Running it
 * twice in a minute changes nothing the second time.
 *
 * **An issue somebody is working on does not escalate.** Acknowledged and in-progress are answers.
 * Escalating them would punish the seller for telling the truth about what they are doing, and teach
 * them not to.
 *
 * **It stops at critical.** There is nothing above it, and a level that kept counting would be a
 * number nobody could act on differently.
