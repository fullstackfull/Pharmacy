/**
 * The seller's day, in numbers that were counted rather than estimated.
 *
 * Every figure here comes from a query over real rows. There is no forecasting, no smoothing and no
 * projection — a briefing that guessed would be read as fact the next morning and acted on.
 *
 * The comparison is the part that carries the meaning. "124 orders" says nothing without yesterday's
 * number beside it, and a percentage against a day that had no orders is arithmetic that produces
 * infinity, so it is reported as null and the client says "no comparison" rather than "+∞%".
