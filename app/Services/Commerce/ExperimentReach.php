/**
 * Who actually saw each variant.
 *
 * Assignment being stable is half of an experiment; the other half is the measurement, and it had
 * no reader: the web beacon and the app both stamp an impression with `experiment: key:variant`,
 * the recorder stores it, and no screen ever asked. A merchant "running" an experiment was
 * running it blind — they could stop it, but never learn anything from it.
 *
 * This is the reader. Distinct visitors, not events: the same shopper scrolling past the hero on
 * five visits is one person who saw variant B. Thirty days, matching the section-reach window, so
 * the two numbers beside each other on the admin's screens mean the same kind of thing.
