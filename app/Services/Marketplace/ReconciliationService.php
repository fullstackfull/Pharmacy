/**
 * Financial reconciliation (Phase 3, Stage E).
 *
 * A read-only integrity check over the financial core built in Stage B — the vendor ledger, the
 * commission snapshots, and the settlements. It asserts the invariants those pieces are supposed to
 * hold and reports anything that drifts. It writes nothing; a green report is the expected result and
 * a valuable one — it is the monitor that would catch a future bug the moment it corrupts a balance.
 *
 * Each check returns its scope, how many things it examined, and a list of discrepancies (empty when
 * everything reconciles). Every comparison is derived in PHP from portable aggregate queries, so it
 * runs identically on MariaDB and the SQLite test database.
