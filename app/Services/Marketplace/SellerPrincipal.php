 * Who is acting, and on whose shop.
 *
 * Every seller endpoint scopes its work to a shop. Until now that shop and the person asking were
 * the same thing, because only an owner could hold an API token — which is also why a staff member
 * could not use the seller app at all, and why anyone holding an owner's token got owner rights with
 * none of the permission matrix applied.
 *
 * Separating the two is the whole point: `sellerId` stays the shop, so every existing query that
 * scopes on it keeps meaning exactly what it meant; `staffId` and `permissions` say what this
 * particular person may do inside it.
