/**
 * What happened in this shop, and who did it.
 *
 * `audit_logs` is one table for the whole platform, so the hard part is deciding which of its rows
 * belong to one seller. Two things make a row theirs, and both are needed:
 *
 * The actor was them — the owner's own account, one of their staff, or a key they issued. Staff ids are read fresh
 * rather than stored on the row, so an employee who has since left still shows up in the history of
 * what they did, which is exactly when a seller most wants to look.
 *
 * Or the row says so — anything the marketplace recorded *about* this shop carries the shop's id in
 * its context, and a seller should be able to see the decisions taken about them, not only the ones
 * they took themselves.
 *
 * Rows matching neither are somebody else's. There is no filter a caller can pass to widen this.
