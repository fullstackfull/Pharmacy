/**
 * Does what the seller sold add up to what the seller was credited?
 *
 * The platform already reconciles itself — `ReconciliationService` checks the ledger's running
 * balance, the commission snapshots and the settlements, across every shop, for whoever runs the
 * marketplace. None of that reaches the seller, who has the same question about their own money and
 * no way to ask it: they can see orders, and they can see a balance, and nothing joins the two.
 *
 * So this walks the same chain one shop at a time and shows each hand-off:
 *
 *   delivered lines → an earning recorded for each → a credit in the ledger for each
 *
 * and names what fell out at every step. A line delivered with no earning recorded is money the
 * seller has earned and not been told about; an earning with no credit is money recorded and not
 * paid into the balance. Both are real states with real causes — settlement not yet run, a job that
 * failed — and both are things a seller is entitled to see rather than discover a month later.
 *
 * Nothing here is estimated. Every figure is a sum over rows that exist, and where a row does not
 * exist the answer is that it does not exist.
