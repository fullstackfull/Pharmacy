/**
 * Telling a seller's own systems what happened in their shop.
 *
 * The catalogue of events is a fixed list rather than anything a caller can name, because an event
 * is a promise: once something subscribes to `order.placed`, that name and that payload shape have
 * to keep meaning the same thing. A dispatcher that forwarded any string it was handed would make
 * every internal rename a breaking change for somebody's integration.
 *
 * Every delivery is signed. Without a signature a webhook endpoint is a URL that does something when
 * anybody POSTs to it, and the seller has no way to tell our delivery from a forged one.
 *
 * An endpoint that keeps failing is disabled rather than retried for ever. A queue full of
 * deliveries to a URL that stopped existing months ago is a queue that stops delivering the ones
 * that would have worked.
