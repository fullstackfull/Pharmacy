 * Seller SLA policy and breach ledger (Phase 3, Stage E).
 *
 * Turns the point-in-time scorecard into an enforceable policy: configurable thresholds, evaluated
 * against a seller's metrics, producing a breach ledger that opens when a line is crossed and clears
 * when the seller comes back inside it. It reuses SellerScorecardService for the numbers — one source
 * of truth, so the SLA and the scorecard can never disagree about a seller's cancellation rate.
 *
 * The comparison itself (`breachesFor`) is a pure function, so the policy is testable without a
 * database and any caller evaluating a hypothetical gets the same answer the ledger would record.
