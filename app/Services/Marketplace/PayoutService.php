/**
 * Seller-initiated payouts over the ledger, with the security controls the phase asks for
 * (Phase 3, Stage B).
 *
 * The existing `withdraw_requests` flow runs over `seller_wallets` and validates nothing against a
 * real available balance. This runs over the ledger:
 *
 *   - A payout can only ask for what the ledger reports as **available**. Money still inside the
 *     return window (`pending`), or already reserved for another payout, is not requestable.
 *   - Requesting **reserves** the amount as a ledger debit with status `reserved`, so the same money
 *     cannot be requested twice, and a settlement cannot pay it out from under a live request.
 *   - Rejecting or failing a request **releases** the reservation — a credit that puts the money
 *     back — so nothing is lost when a payout does not go through.
 *   - Paying converts the reservation into a `paid` debit.
 *
 * ## The bank-change cooling period
 *
 * The control the specification names: changing a seller's bank details is logged and opens a
 * cooling window during which payouts are refused. It is the standard defence against an account
 * takeover that immediately redirects the money — the delay gives the real seller time to notice a
 * payout they did not make. `requestPayout()` refuses while the window is open.
