/**
 * Appends to a vendor's financial ledger, and reads balances back out of it (Phase 3, Stage B).
 *
 * The balance is never stored as a number somebody updates. It is the sum of the entries, and each
 * entry carries the balance as of itself so a statement can be printed without re-summing history.
 *
 * ## Why the lock
 *
 * `balance_after` is a read-then-write: read the previous balance, add this entry, write the result.
 * Two events landing together would otherwise both read the same previous balance and both write
 * their own — the identical lost-update that cost this project a stock decrement in Phase 2. The
 * previous entry's row is locked for the rest of the transaction, so the second event waits and
 * then reads the balance the first one just wrote.
 *
 * ## Why nothing is ever edited
 *
 * A correction is a new entry. An edited ledger cannot be reconciled against anything, and the one
 * question a ledger exists to answer — "what did this look like at the time?" — stops having an
 * answer the moment a row is rewritten.
