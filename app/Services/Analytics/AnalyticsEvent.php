     * The events a browser is allowed to send: ONLY those the server cannot see for itself.
     *
     * Two rules decide this list, and the second one is easy to get wrong.
     *
     * First, nothing money-related is ever accepted from a client. A page that could post
     * "order_placed" with a value of its choosing would make revenue analytics a suggestion box.
     *
     * Second — and this is the one that silently corrupts numbers rather than obviously breaking
     * them — an event the server ALREADY records must not be accepted from the browser too. A
     * product view is recorded by ProductDetailsController, a wishlist add by the Wishlist model
     * event, a checkout start by WebController. Accepting those here would count each of them
     * twice, and the deduplication would not catch it: the two paths disagree about the path
     * (a normalised route pattern against the browser's actual URL), so they hash differently.
     *
     * What is left is one thing: the product filter's pushState navigations, which return JSON and
     * are correctly not counted as pageviews.
     *
     * This list used to also carry cart_viewed and compare_added, on the belief that neither had a
     * server-side equivalent. Neither could ever fire — no element in the theme carries the
     * data-analytics attribute that would have sent them — so both were an allow-list entry for an
     * event that did not exist, and the cart step of every funnel was empty for a reason no screen
     * could show. Both are recorded on the server now, where they always belonged: the cart page is
     * a page load the server serves, and a compare add is a row the server writes.
