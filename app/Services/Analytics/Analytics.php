/**
 * The one door into analytics.
 *
 * Every instrumentation point in the application — a controller, a service, a listener — calls a
 * named method here rather than building an event by hand. That is the difference between a schema
 * and a convention: with one door, "add to cart" has a single spelling, a single set of properties
 * and a single place to change when the shop changes. Without it, six controllers invent six
 * shapes and the funnel silently stops joining up.
 *
 * Every method is safe to call from anywhere, including inside a database transaction and inside a
 * queued job: nothing here queries, nothing throws, and nothing is written until the response has
 * already been sent.
