 * did nothing — a shop that had switched both on believed it was honouring a signal it had never
 * looked at. Both are decided here, once, so there is one answer rather than one per call site.
 *
 * Both default to OFF, which is the behaviour every existing installation already has. Turning
 * either on is a deliberate act by an administrator, and this class is what makes that act mean
