/**
 * Writes events, and is not allowed to matter.
 *
 * The rule that shapes every line here: if analytics fails, the shop does not. Events are buffered
 * in memory during the request and written once, after the response has been sent, in a single
 * bulk insert. Nothing on the checkout path waits for this, nothing on it can throw through to a
 * customer, and an unreachable analytics database costs the merchant a row in a report — never an
 * order.
 *
 * Two other properties are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - IDEMPOTENCE, where it is asked for. Events carry a dedupe key and the table has a unique
 *    index on it. What that key covers decides what is actually collapsed, and the two cases are
 *    not the same strength: an act that names its own key — an order, a payment — is one row
 *    however many times its page is reloaded, for as long as the rows are kept. An act that does
 *    not is collapsed only when the duplicate lands in the SAME few-second bucket, so a
 *    double-submitted form usually produces one row and a retry that straddles a bucket boundary
 *    produces two. That is the deliberate trade — see dedupeKey() — and it is worth stating
 *    plainly, because "duplicates are collapsed" would read as a guarantee it does not make.
 *    Revenue counted twice is worse than revenue not counted at all, because nobody goes looking
 *    for a number that is too high, and that is exactly why the money events carry explicit keys.
 *
 *  - REDACTION. Properties pass through the same redactor the monitoring system uses, so a
 *    password, an OTP, a token or a card number cannot reach this table by way of a well-meaning
 *    instrumentation call somewhere else in the codebase.
