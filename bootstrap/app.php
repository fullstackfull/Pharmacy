| CLI — and any asset-URL generation off the queue (e.g. a queued notification
| building a product thumbnail URL via dynamicStorage()) fatally errored. Define
| the conventional default here when a web entry hasn't already set it, so CLI
| matches web. Deployments that point the domain at the project root can override
