/*
 | First-party analytics beacon.
 |
 | The server already records every page load, so this file exists only for the things a page load
 | cannot see:
 |
 |  1. The product filter navigates with history.pushState and a jQuery request. Filtering,
 |     sorting and changing a price range are real page changes that return JSON, so the server
 |     counts them as an XHR and — correctly — not as a pageview. Without this they are simply
 |     lost, and on a catalogue site that is a large share of all navigation.
 |  2. Interactions that never navigate and write nothing on the server, should the theme ever add
 |     one. The delegated [data-analytics] handler below is that extension point; today nothing in
 |     the theme carries the attribute, and an event the server already records is refused here
 |     rather than counted twice.
 |
 | Deliberately small, dependency-free and defensive. It runs on every storefront page of a live
 | shop, so it must never throw into a customer's console, never block a click, and never delay a
 | page. Everything is wrapped, everything is queued, and the queue is flushed with sendBeacon so
 | the browser can post it during unload without holding the page open.
 |
 | It sends NOTHING about the person. No form values, no input contents, no scroll heatmap, no
 | fingerprint — an event name, an entity id and a normalised path.
